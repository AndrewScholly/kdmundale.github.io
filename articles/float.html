      <p>The old wooden door creaked loudly as I pushed it open, walking into the parlor of the first floor of a turn-of-the-century row home in downtown Lancaster, a space full of character. Old painted wood floors dipped and sloped towards the
        front. Fourteen foot tall ceilings met with original crown molding in every corner, wavy and warped with time. Floor to ceiling windows along the front flooded the entire space with natural light, illuminating the art that hung on every
        available space: tattoo art, pages and pages of framed flash, much of it aged brown by years of exposure to smoke and light. There’s no more smoking in tattoo shops, but the faintest smell of pot lingered in the air.</p>
      <p>“Hey, Ben!”</p>
      <p>He looked up from his drafting table through his thick rimmed square frames. “Hey, Kate,” he replied. “You ready for this?” Ben looks every bit as you think a tattoo artist would. He should, after all; he’s been in the business over twenty
        years.</p>
      <p>“You know I’m fucking ready!” I smiled, unable to hide my excitement. New ink always gets me going, but this one especially had me jazzed. Inspiration had come suddenly for this piece. It meant something. “I’ve been ready since I asked you
        to draw it up.”</p>
      <p>Ben got up and walked across the room to meet me at the counter. For a big guy, I couldn’t help but notice how gracefully he moved. Familiarity with the space, maybe. From his neck down every inch of exposed skin is adorned with tattoos.
        Some dark and new, some blue and faded. They seem to almost blend seamlessly into each other, like an old blue paisley tie. He slid a piece of tracing paper in front of me. “What do you think?”
        <p>“It’s perfect,” I replied.</p>
        <p>A few months before, I was sitting on the edge of my bed, feet propped up on the window ledge. The afternoon sun comes directly in my bedroom windows, casting long, warm pools of light across my bed. My room was a wreck. My face was a
          wreck. I had been up there crying for what felt like forever.</p>
        <p>I don’t want to assume that everyone knows what heartbreak feels like. At some point in all of our lives we experience it. It’s difficult for me to put that pain into words. A low, persistent, deep burn in your chest. Lungs feel tight,
          almost banded, and it hurts to breathe. Like someone you loved most was putting out a cigarette on your left ventricle. It had been a while since he left. Since I learned the truth. Since the deception and lies had come to light. Since the
          other girl, the younger girl, the girl without kids had come and he left with her. But I was still hurting. There was still a big, empty space.</p>
        <p>I had been out with other men. I hadn’t been sitting like and old spinster full of bitterness. Dinners, dancing, even a mini vacation with really nice guys had been fun. But here I was, still crying, still crushed. That cigarette still
          wasn’t out. I still felt as though my whole world had been pulled out from beneath me. After four years together, he had been the only father my youngest son had known. I had plans. We were supposed to be partners, and this was going to be
          our life. I had so much hope for us. I had fallen in love so deeply with the idea of what we could be, I had completely overlooked what we had become. So lost in the potential, I failed to see the reality.</p>
        <p>Sitting there in my own misery was when I heard the song for the first time. He had been the one to introduce me to the band Coheed & Cambria in the first place. Although I teased him for listening to it, secretly I fell in love with
          Claudio’s lyrics. Dark, deep, honest, and hopeful- his words put to song brought out feelings I had never been able to express. I could hear my life in all of his music: good, bad, ugly and really fucked up. We would fight with song
          passages and we would make up with them too. Our best night together had been at a Coheed & Cambria concert. It was a sweet sorrow, listening to them now, alone. I had been waiting months for this album to be released. What better time to
          listen to it? Claudio would know exactly what to say. The song Love Protocol began. His powerful voice filled my headset. The chorus came, and the words cut through me.</p>
        <p>Hold on to me / Tell me you’ve got me, sweetheart<br>
          The world is going dim in my gaze<br>
          <p>Fuck. God damn it, Claudio.</p>
          <p>Sweet vertigo / Feel my lungs heaving, choking / Clawing down my back, panic attack</p>
          <p>What was just an ember flashed into a fire consuming my entire heart. Really, Claudio, how? I felt a wave come over me. More tears. Claudio crooned, half singing, half screaming-
            <p>I’m alone, watch me float as I fall</p>
            <p>Ben did a perfect job with my drawing. A solitary astronaut, tethered to nothing, adrift in the cosmos. How more forsaken could someone be? Below the astronaut, in retro sci-fi text, the lyric “Watch me float as I fall.” This image
              first came to me that day on the bed. The feeling of complete loneliness. Unanchored. In the beginning I felt a comforting, sorrowful connection to the words. I played the song on repeat. On the stereo at work, driving, through my
              headphones everywhere I went, the ballad had become my personal soundtrack.</p>
            <p>Silly, right? A grown ass woman who’s endured far worse then a cheating boyfriend seemingly crippled by the thought of being alone. Yeah, he hurt me, but I came to see it wasn’t his betrayal leaving me so broken. Far worse. I had
              defined my whole self with my relationship. It was the fear of not having anyone which terrified me and kept me in something long past its expiration date. Nobody would ever love me again with all my baggage: my children, my past, my
              aging face and body. He hadn’t been a good boyfriend at all, but at least he was a boyfriend. Who was I without someone beside me? Just another washed up single mom. The alone, that’s what hurt. The fall, as though I had been standing
              safe in someone’s arms before being flung off a cliff. I have climbed mountains and swam vast oceans of struggle in my life, all while carrying my children on my back. But when it came down to it, I truly thought I was worthless if I
              didn’t have a man to make me worthy. Somewhere I had lost my power.</p>
            <p>“Let’s get going.” Ben led me around the counter. The entire ritual of getting a tattoo seems almost sacred to me. I offered up my flesh. Ben washed the area from my shoulder to my elbow, and then took a razor to all the fine blonde
              hair that would get in the way. He used carbon transfer paper to put the design in place. It was huge, filling my entire upper-arm. Fitting, I thought, since I wore my heart on my sleeve anyway. I walked over to the mirror and inspected
              the layout.
              <p>“How long are you thinking this will take?”</p>
              <p>“Five, five and a half hours maybe…. The color in the galaxy swirl is what’s going to take the most time,” he answered without looking up, readying his table. Ink had been poured into tiny caps in neat rows. Blue, several shades of
                purple, white, yellow, teal and bright green were a contrast to the weathered patterns on the wall behind them. He could’ve told me ten hours and I still would’ve agreed.
                <p>The tattoo gun makes a hum low enough to speak comfortably over but somehow still engulfs the space. I have always found it hypnotic and relaxing. Unlike other artists I’ve gone to, Ben doesn’t feel the need to make small talk. We
                  can sit for hours in silence. In my life, there’s rarely silence. Working 5 nights a week, raising three boys on my own, and soon starting college full time left very little room for quiet. Since that day on my bed, I had been
                  grateful for the chaos. Staying busy helped, a lot, filling my little free time with gym and coffee and friends. My father had even stayed with us for a couple months on a visit from Europe. It was only in the still of the evenings,
                  alone in bed when I didn’t have company or some potential date to chat with, the loneliness would creep back in. But something was starting to be different. The needle moves in and out of the skin too quickly to feel each individual
                  prick. I’ve described it as a long, single cat scratch when people ask. The dermis begins to swell and with every wipe of the artist’s towel becoming a little more tender. It’s cathartic, and draining, a physical manifestation of
                  emotional pain. The burn of the needle accompanied by the sound of the gun and Ben’s heavy metal playing in the background put me into a trance. I started thinking about him, about the years together. There were good times of
                  course, but there were far many more bad. I thought about the day I found out he was moving in with another woman and the pain of losing him. I was in anguish. The fall was a spiraling fiery plummet. It felt like the wound would
                  never heal.
                  <p>“How are you doing?” Ben asked. We were four hours in. I was sore, but the piece was coming to life. The stars glistened with the moisture of sanitizer and my own blood. My arm was starting to swell.</p>
                  <p>“I’m good. Let’s get it done.”</p>
                  <p>I may have been falling back then, lost in anguish, but I realized I didn’t feel like that anymore. I felt I might suffocate under the weight of all that pain, but I didn’t. I was doing ok. The kids were great. I had been able to
                    spend more time with them doing the things we love to do. All the bills were paid, and there was a little extra in the bank. I was in the best shape of my life physically, and people were noticing. Apparently, guys don’t care if
                    you have kids so long as you’ve got your shit together and you look good in leggings. I even started reading again and watching the nerdiest documentaries I wanted as I fell asleep. I received my spring semester schedule for
                    college, meaning I was actually going to go back to school. Floating almost, with new hope about where my life was going to take me. Alone didn’t break me after all. The fall wasn’t a never ending descent. I was simply set adrift.
                    I couldn’t grow any further stuck where I was; clinging desperately to a dying ship out of fear of the unknown, rather then let go and sail alone.</p>
                  <p>He was right. Five and a half hours. I was throbbing. “Done,” Ben said as he shut off the gun. I walked back over to the full length mirror. There he was, my spaceman, in full technicolor glory. In the background stars whirled in
                    a galactic spiral. The tether looped around behind him, ending in a small heart above the words. Unmoored in a universe of possibilities, free to go wherever the cosmos led him. I didn’t want to cry in front of Ben.</p>
                  <p>“It’s better then I ever imagined.”</p>
