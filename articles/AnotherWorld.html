      <p>The snow was just starting to fall as I pulled up to Jordan’s house. He’s twenty-seven, tall, thin, a street magician, and sober. He’s been living in Lancaster for two years after getting sober in Philadelphia. Today we’re heading back
        there, in spite of the impending weather, to visit a friend and attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in Kensington. Kensington has made many headlines recently due to its overwhelming heroin epidemic. What was once a nice neighborhood with
        a booming manufacturing workforce in the 40s, has slowly been deindustrialized and fallen deeper and deeper into poverty over the last sixty years. With one of the highest unemployment rates in the area, Kensington is now referred to as the
        “badlands.”</p>
      <p>“They call it the Kensington Shuffle,” Jordan laughed, as he slouched in my front seat, mimicking the position of someone high on opiates. Where many would be offended, recovering addicts find a lot of relief in making fun of themselves,
        myself included. Jordan continued, “I once saw a guy fall out in the summer on a freshly tarred parking lot. The hot pavement had given him second and third degree burns before anyone had realized what was going on.” Jordan was in charge of
        the music as we headed east, playing songs that spoke to both of our depressed natures.</p>
      <p>Jordan talked about the differences in the recovery communities between Lancaster and Philadelphia and said, “Recovery is a lot different out here. People are desperate. They understand it’s life or death. I think Lancaster AA has drifted
        away from that.” </p>
      <p>Over the past six or seven years the recovery community in the Lancaster area has grown exponentially. With several rehabs in the area, both private and state funded, people are transplanting in order to complete their aftercare and start
        life over. The city is full of sober recovery houses. Residents are charged a weekly rate to live in a structured environment with other people in recovery. Business is booming. Jordan continued, “More and more rich parents are shipping their
        kids out to Lancaster to get sober. A lot of the people in these meetings out here have no idea what desperation is anymore.” He is right. The church basements where I once sought experience and hope now overflowed with twenty-nothings
        dressed to impress. Crowded rooms full of fresh faced kids from wealthy suburbs, many of whom having just barely tapped the surface of the addiction ocean. They’re young, ego filled, horny, and full of hope. None of those characteristics
        usually bode well in AA. </p>
      <p>We were heading to Eddie’s house, just off of I-76 in a part of south Philadelphia referred to as Gray’s Ferry. As we pulled onto his street and looked for parking, the neighborhood was a world apart from what I was used to in Lancaster.
        Small, two-story brick buildings lined the narrow streets with gated garage doors and bars over windows. Eddie opened his door, dressed in sweats, and greeted us with his thick Philly accent, “Bout fucking time you made it out here to see
        me!” Eddie is 43. He has two grown children and a grandson whose pictures adorn his walls. His home is clean and stylish, with the biggest white leather couch I’ve ever seen. I’ve known Eddie for four years. He used to live in Lancaster. He's
        the man who helped me get sober, and his story of recovery is amazing. He's traveled the country doing TED talks about homelessness and remains a very active member in the recovery community, even after five years of sobriety. He moved back
        to Philly for work and said, “But it was the best thing I could’ve done for my sobriety, too. I feel like I’ve been recharged. The problem is so much worse out here, but the people come in so much more willing to get help.”
        <p>The snow was falling heavily by the time we made it to Fishtown. Once a neighborhood just as bad as Kensington, Fishtown is now booming, full of trendy new restaurants and breweries and skyrocketing real estate. Directly bordering
          Kensington, Fishtown is a stark contrast to where we were heading. “Are you paying attention, Kate?” Eddie asked. “We’re coming up on the spot where I copped my first bag of dope!” We all started laughing, but the block we passed was
          anything but funny. Eddie grew up in Kensington. “There’s the house I was raised in,” he said. The two spots weren’t even one hundred yards apart. </p>
        <p>“Welcome to the Badlands,” Jordan sighed. About half of Philadelphia’s entire homeless population lives in Kensington, an area roughly 1/30th the size of the entire city. In spite of the city clearing out two major camps in 2018, many of
          the abandoned buildings and underpasses are still used for refuge. “Not even the snow stops the boys,” said Jordan. He motioned towards a small group of men standing on a corner. Every other house was boarded up. Anywhere an overhang
          stretched over the sidewalk, tents were erected with trash bags piled all around.</p>
        <p>We turned onto Kensington Ave. The SEPTA rail runs on elevated tracks above the street, colloquially known as “the El.” Eddie pointed toward the intersection of Kensington and Somerset and siad, “People just know to make it here, and
          you’ll be able to score. Kids from all over just know to make it to the El, and you’re good.”</p>
        <p>A few blocks down we pulled over, right under the El. The AA clubhouse we were headed to lies right in the heart of all this darkness. We walked in through a group of smokers standing just outside. You could tell a few of them were
          carrying their whole world with them in their backpacks. Inside the clubhouse, the crowd looked nothing like what I was used to: Older. Worn. Tired. The entire atmosphere felt heavy with years of experience and suffering. No silly girls
          giggling in the corner, flirting with the bros on the other side of the room. No posturing, or braggadocious vibrato when sharing in order to impress everyone else. Men sat in silence, tired. The women had an edge to them that couldn’t be
          hidden by hair or makeup. But appearances weren’t important here. There was a higher purpose to this gathering. Everyone in this room was here with only one thing in mind: just stay sober one more day. For most everyone in the room, it was
          a mission of life or death.
          <p>I listened intently as the speaker began to share his story. He had driven down from New Jersey to be there. Although I had never heard him speak before, his story was so familiar. Many of our stories follow a classic arc, including the
            rise and fall of our vices, how one day they worked and the next they didn’t. We laughed at our ridiculous shared sick mentality. The room was quiet, respectful, and listening. I couldn’t help but think of a similar meeting I had just
            attended in Lancaster, only the room had been filed with chatter.</p>
          <p>When the speaker concluded, finishing with how the process AA offers as a solution saved his life, we all applauded. People in the room then began to raise their hands and share in turn what resonated with them from his life. There was
            more laughter at folly and broken thinking, but there were tears as well. A young lady, freshly off the street and finally in a warm home for the winter, talked about her continued battle with staying clean and off “the Ave” (referring to
            Kensington Ave, where many young women prostitute themselves in order to support their habits). She was twenty-seven, had lost both of her children to the state, and sounded desperate to change. Stories like this are common here. The pain
            is palpable, and humbling. Another gentleman talked about not having anywhere warm to go for the night. He had just been released from the hospital having receiving treatment for an abscess that had gone septic behind his knee. He was in
            his late thirties, but he looked well over fifty. In spite of the harsh truth of his situation, he genuinely wanted to stay clean. The desperation was in his voice and his eyes, and everyone could feel it.</p>
          <p>The meeting ended, and I waited for Jordan and Eddie as they made their rounds greeting all the people they had known. Some bundled up, donning layer upon layer as they prepared to venture out into the cold, snowy night outside. The
            gentleman who had shared about being homeless was surrounded by a group of men, a few of whom were on their phones making calls to see about getting him a place inside for the night. The young woman had been approached by two older ladies
            and was being embraced by them. I just stood back and took in the realness of this scene. These were people at the end of the line. There were no parents paying their weekly rent. No support group backing them up and pushing them in the
            right direction. No safety net. No slap-on-the-wrist repercussions for partying too much. This was the end game for them; it was do or die.
            <p>We made our way back to the car. The snow was laying heavy and wet on the streets now. It was going to be a long and cold night for many people in Kensington. Some would succumb to the misery and chase their reality away with drugs and
              alcohol. A few, however, were going to make it one more day. And that thought fueled me the whole way home to Lancaster in the snow, full of gratitude.</p>
