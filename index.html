        <h2>Bringing <em>unique, original perspective</em> to everything I do.</h2>
        <p><em>I'm not your avearge programmer.</em>Years in the service industry as a single mother of three boys has taught me much about people, and even more about how to <em>solve problems creatively</em>.</p>
        <p>Motivated by my passion for learning and accompanied by my strong work ethic, in my mid thirties I decided it was time for a change.</p>
        <p>I enrolled in the <em><a target="blank" href="https://stevenscollege.edu/academics/associate-degrees/computer-software-engineering-technology/">Computer Software Engineering Technology</a></em> program at <a target="blank"
            href="https://stevenscollege.edu">Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology</a>, and began a long two years of full time instruction, full time motherhood, and full time <em>life</em></p>
